# Python-based Optimal Portfolio Construction using Modern Portfolio Theory
This project is focused on building a Python-based algorithm for optimal portfolio construction using Modern Portfolio Theory techniques. The project includes data analysis and statistical modeling using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly libraries.

## Installation
To use this project, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. The project also requires the following Python libraries:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
- YFinance

## Usage
To use this project, you can simply clone or download the repository to your local machine. Once you have the files, you can run the portfolio_construction.ipynb notebook to explore the algorithm and conduct portfolio analysis.

The notebook includes the following sections:

- Data Cleaning and Preparation: This section focuses on cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- Data Analysis: This section includes statistical analysis and visualization of the data to better understand the characteristics of the assets in the portfolio.
- Optimal Portfolio Construction: This section includes the implementation of the Modern Portfolio Theory algorithm to construct the optimal portfolio.
- Portfolio Analysis: This section includes the analysis of the optimal portfolio constructed in the previous section, including risk and return metrics, efficient frontier plot, and other performance measures.
